# krpano-linkedscene_lookat-adder
In the krpano version 1.21.2 (build 2023-12-11) there is a bug, that with existing vtours with hotspots that DO NOT have the linkedscene_lookat attribute the feature of adding a "Target Startup View" to existing hotspots is not working. This Adder adds a linkedscene_lookat to all hotspots.
